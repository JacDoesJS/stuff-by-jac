                    <p>This one-of-a-kind bag has lots of inside pockets and contains a mixture of new and reclaimed fabrics.
                        The front pocket panel is handwoven from a mix of cotton and cotton-acrylic yarns, some with thick and thin 
                        properties which create textural interest.</p>
                    <p>This prototype is perfect for everyday use. I know this as I have been testing it. I get a lot of admiring 
                        comments and look forward to making more in other colours and with different handwoven fabrics.</p>

                    <p>No-one else will have a bag quite like this. It's made from a mix of riotously joyful handwoven orange
                        mostly cotton fabric and reclaimed teal curtain remnants. It's padded with thick cotton calico to give some protection
                        to your gadgets.</p>
                    <p>Going to meetings will definitely be much more fun when you can carry your tech in a beautiful bag such as this.</p>

                    <p>All the colours of a summer meadow are here: little wild orchids, in jewel tones, are hiding amongst a wide variety of
                        green grass shades. <p>
                    <p>There is also a handy zip bag made from a sturdy grey cotton linen and featuring matching handwoven fabric.</p>

                    <p>Many of my customers appreciate a short neck warmer, without lots of scarf dangling and getting in their way.
                        This one has all the vibrant shades of deciduous woodland late in the season.<p>
                    <p>It features a UK-made button and a chinese-style button closure.</p>

                    <p>We are all trying to do our bit for the environment and present wrappings are so often used so briefly.
                        Here's an alternative form of present wrapping which is a gift in itself. The outer is made from recycled
                        curtain fabric and features a handwoven red cotton heart.<p>
                    <p>Imagine arriving at a party with one of these beauties.</p>

                  <h4 id="storage">Storage Pocket</h4>
                    <p>For those who like more subtle colours, this storage pocket will compliment any green, blue, or beige
                        decor. It can be folded up and put away when not in use. Surely it's too uniquely lovely to be hidden away though?!<p>
                    <p>I definitely want to make more of these in different colours as they don't hang around in my shop for long.</p>

                    <p>As I love bright colours, of course I adore making rainbow fabrics. This one features organised, symmetrical stripes
                         with a central flash of yellow.<p>
                    <p>Channel your inner rock god with this David Bowie style case.</p>

                  <h4 id="water">Water Lilies Luxury Scarf</h4>
                    <p>Some weavers complain about the work involved in putting the long vertical warp threads on the loom. I don't.
                        It's one of my absolute favourite things to do. I think the warp for this scarf was one of the longest to prepare
                        as every warp strand is made up of two threads. I hope you agree that it is reminiscent of Monet's paintings of water lilies.<p>
                    <p>The combination of cotton and bamboo make for a luxuriously soft feel on the neck.</p>

                    <p>Yes vegan 'taxidermy' is a thing these days - what fun! Imagine animal trophy heads made from knitting or vibrant fabrics.
                        Seeing these inspired me to make some butterflies of my own. I fully indulge my joy of combining colourful yarns to make the fabric
                        for these and then combine with offcuts stitched on with multiple coloured threads. The antennae are made from 
                        garden wire wrapped with cotton yarn and the velvet ribbon is reclaimed.<p>
                    <p>Nursery, hallway, living room - where would you put yours?</p>
